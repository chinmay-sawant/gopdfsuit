### 2. Delta Analysis (Spike Test)

| Metric          | v1.24 (Optimized) | v1.26 (Optimization 3) | Change          |
| :-------------- | :---------------- | :--------------------- | :-------------- |
| **Throughput**  | 78.64 req/s       | 78.15 req/s            | -0.6%           |
| **Avg Latency** | 35.39ms           | 38.77ms                | +9.6% (Slower)  |
| **p95 Latency** | 324.49ms          | 364.19ms               | +12.2% (Slower) |
| **p99 Latency** | 575.54ms          | 738.94ms               | +28.4% (Slower) |

## Observations

- **Improved Low-Load Latency:** Under light load (Smoke/Load tests), Go 1.26 actually outperforms 1.24 with significantly better p95 latency (7.55ms vs 12.83ms) and average latency.
- **High-Load Regression:** Under the heavy contention of the Spike test (100 VUs), the 1.26 version shows signs of regression. p99 latency increased by ~28%, suggesting that tail latency is more affected by the higher load in this version.
- **Soak Test Stability:** The soak test also exhibits higher tail latencies (p95 of 332ms vs 26ms in 1.24), further pointing towards potential GC pressure or resource contention issues over sustained periods in the new version.

> **Conclusion:** While 1.26 offers tighter latency loops for low traffic, it currently struggles more than 1.24 to maintain that consistency under heavy concurrency.
